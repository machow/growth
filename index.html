<h1>increase the size of your ask</h1>
<p>When someone asks how they can help telling them to wait is a bad idea.
You might want to write something up, or get things ready.
But if you're like me it won't happen.</p>
<p>Maybe someone who wants to help can help with these bigger asks: the write-ups and the getting readies.</p>

<h1>daily notes are garbage. beautiful garbage.</h1>
<p>At different points in my life, I've tried keeping notes in different ways.
The most common focus has been this: remembering what I'm reading today a month from now.</p>
<p>Nowadays I take the opposite approach.
I want to remember the things from today for today.
But the bulk of that will be garbage.
So I take quick daily notes.
Once I get to a certain level of understanding, I write newer more permenant notes (ad infinitum).</p>
