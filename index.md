# increase the size of your ask

When someone asks how they can help telling them to wait is a bad idea.
You might want to write something up, or get things ready.
But if you're like me it won't happen.

Maybe someone who wants to help can help with these bigger asks: the write-ups and the getting readies.

I feel like the cure for flashcard dread, when studying cantonese, is going to a Chinese bakery.

# daily notes are garbage. beautiful garbage.

At different points in my life, I've tried keeping notes in different ways.
The most common focus has been this: remembering what I'm reading today a month from now.

Nowadays I take the opposite approach.
I want to remember the things from today for today.
But the bulk of that will be garbage.
So I take quick daily notes.
Once I get to a certain level of understanding, I write newer more permenant notes (ad infinitum).
