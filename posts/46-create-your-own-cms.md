# Create your own CMS

There is a classic trope: If you create your own content management system (CMS),
you'll spend all your time adding features to it.

I'm not sure this is a problem with creating your own CMS so much as feature management.
If your goal is to write, then you have 3 options:

1. **Mysterious** - Use an existing CMS, and pray its many featureful behaviors don't derail you.
2. **Wasteful** - Create your own featureful CMS.
3. **Constrained** - Create a CMS with very few features.

The downside of a constrained CMS is that you won't be able to write absolutely everything you could dream of.
That sounds like the kind of problem you should start thinking about _after_ you've been writing for a while, not before.
