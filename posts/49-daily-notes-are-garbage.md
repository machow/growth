# daily notes are garbage. beautiful garbage.

At different points in my life, I've tried keeping notes in different ways.
The most common focus has been this: remembering what I'm reading today a month from now.

Nowadays I take the opposite approach.
I want to remember the things from today for today.
But the bulk of that will be garbage.
So I take quick daily notes.
Once I get to a certain level of understanding, I write newer more permenant notes (ad infinitum).
